  Genre: [
    "The Gospel is a biographical-historical narrative driven by theological purposes, similar to Old Testament writings."
  ],
  "Key principles of preaching the Gospels:": [
    "Main question — Who is Jesus? (based on His deeds and words)",
    "Supporting question — How should we respond to Jesus? (based on what He said or did)? Faith and following.",
    "Allegorization minimizes the greatness of Jesus, because we pull the text out of context and insert our own understanding (e.g., calming the storm = calming inner anxiety). Allegory is subjective (depending on a person’s theology, they will insert their own meaning)."
  ],
  "Authorship of Matthew": [
    "Church Fathers unanimously affirm Matthew’s authorship.",
    "Matt. 10:3 — he uses his new name Matthew ('gift of God') given at conversion, and refers to his former occupation ('tax collector'); a sign of the author's humility, as other Gospel writers refer to him as Levi or Matthew without mention of tax collecting.",
    "Matthew often uses specific amounts and monetary terms (talents, denarii, stater, silver coins), unlike other evangelists. This suggests financial literacy and natural interest in money matters, which is logical for a former tax collector (Matt. 28:12–15; 22:19–21; 18:24).",
    "The parable about the scribe (positively) in Matt. 13:52 may refer to Matthew and others like him (although he was not a trained scribe, he was educated and familiar with the Old Testament, so he could remember this parable).",
    "These proofs are not exhaustive but confirm the already accepted fact of Matthew’s authorship."
  ],
  "Who is Matthew?": [
    "A tax collector, likely working for either the Romans or more likely for Herod, considering his Galilean location (a region under Herod’s rule).",
    "Matt. 9:9 — his calling: self-sacrifice, readiness to leave everything.",
    "Matt. 9:10 — he gathers people in his house.",
    "Matt. 10:2 — chosen apostle.",
    "Acts 1:13 — he remained faithful in ministry and discipleship.",
    "According to tradition, Matthew preached to the Jews in Palestine first, and later to Jews of the diaspora after persecution arose."
  ],
  Readers: [
    "Newly converted Hellenistic Jews. A Gospel by a Jew, for Jews, about a Jew.",
    "Jewish expressions: Heavenly Father, Kingdom of Heaven (unique to Matthew; others say 'Kingdom of God'), Son of David.",
    "Many untranslated and unexplained terms: Matt. 5:22 'raca', Matt. 27:6 'korban' (transliterated but not translated).",
    "Traditions mentioned without explanation: hand washing (Matt. 15:2); phylacteries and tassels (Matt. 23:5).",
    "Special attention to prophecies: 'so that it might be fulfilled…' — Matt. 1:22; 2:5, 15, 17, 23; 4:14; 8:17; 12:17; 13:35; 21:4; 27:9.",
    "Special mention of the mission to Israel: 'to the lost sheep of the house of Israel' — Matt. 10:5–6; 15:24."
  ],
  Date: ["40–50 A.D."],
  "Place and Language": ["In Palestine — in Hebrew", "In Antioch — in Greek for diaspora Jews"],
  Style: [
    "Clear structure combining five discourses and corresponding narratives.",
    "Use of literary markers at the end of discourses (Matt. 7:28; 11:1; 13:53; 19:1; 26:1).",
    "Transitional phrases at key points (Matt. 4:17; 16:21).",
    "Thematic organization, often grouped in 2s, 3s, and 7s.",
    "General, panoramic descriptions of events — unlike Mark."
  ],
  "Major Themes": [
    "Matthew presents Jesus as the fulfillment of Israel’s hopes and expectations, while also emphasizing His mission to the Gentiles.",
    "God: the Father (mentioned over 40 times, often in Jesus’ words), the Son (main emphasis — Son of God: beginning — Immanuel; end — 'I am with you always'), and the Holy Spirit.",
    "Kingdom (mentioned over 50 times, not defined — 'Kingdom of Heaven' does not mean in heaven, but coming from heaven, with heavenly nature and character — Matt. 3:1–2; 4:18; 10:7).",
    "Jesus as King — royal genealogy, birth in royal city, worship by magi, Son of David, title on the cross.",
    "Old Testament Scriptures (around 60 quotes and allusions).",
    "Jesus’ teaching (60% of the Gospel is His words, mostly to His disciples — Jesus as teacher).",
    "Righteousness (over 25 times — allusion to OT righteousness).",
    "Jewish leaders and people (their resistance to Jesus leads to the creation of the church).",
    "Church (only Matthew uses the word 'church') — chapter 16 (universal), 18:17 (local).",
    "Gentiles (women in genealogy, magi worship, Matt. 8:11–12 — Gentiles take the place, Matt. 13:18; 27:54 — centurion confesses, Matt. 28:19–20)."
  ],
  "Literary Background": [
    "Literary markers (ending discourses): Matt. 7:28; 11:1; 13:53; 19:1; 26:1.",
    "Narrative markers (major transitions): Matt. 4:17; 16:21 — first phrase marks the start of public ministry, second the end and the shift toward the church.",
    "The opening and closing sections act like a bookend to the Gospel — incarnation and redemption, with alternating discourses and narratives in between."
